# w303

## State of the project
Currently in the process of recovering and re-arranging all the blender files I lost on a corrupted HDD.  

## What is a w303?
The w303 is a shell mod for the Logitech G305 with a shape inspired by the Logitech G303, with no side buttons.  

### Features:
- Fully 3D printable with no required extra hardware (besides some thin copper wire).  
- Robust design, with no creaking, to ensure a proper [gaming] experience.
